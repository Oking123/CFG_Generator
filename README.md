# CFG_Generator

A control flow graph generator is a static program analysis tool, which generates a control flow graph when given a single Python program. Our group developed a novel CFG generator with a more intuitive approach based on an abstract syntax tree with a convenient graphical interface to track the relation between nodes in CFG and the code blocks.
